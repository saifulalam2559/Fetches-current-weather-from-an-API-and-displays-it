# Fetches-current-weather-from-an-API-and-displays-it


## Project: Weather Fetcher
Fetches current weather for a city using OpenWeatherMap API.

### How to run
1. Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the script.
2. Place the file in your PHP server folder (XAMPP, MAMP, Laragon, etc.).
3. Open `weather-fetcher.php` in your browser to see the current weather for Berlin displayed.

### Why it’s valuable
- Uses API requests → shows knowledge of HTTP + JSON handling
- Outputs HTML → practical front-end integration
- Small and self-contained → easy to read & understand
- Real-world functionality → looks professional
